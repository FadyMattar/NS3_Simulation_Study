A project I did in the Technion under the supervision of Dr.Jose Yallouz.

# Project Goal
Comparing congestion control protocols in Data Centers.<br>
researched algorithms like HPCC, TIMELY, DCHCP, etc.<br>
Focused on TCP vs DCTCP, in bottle-neck and Incast situations.<br>

# Some of the parameters that we examined
- RTT
- Queue length on switches and routers
- CWND sizes


# Improved and learnt skills from this project
Linux environment<br>
NS3<br>
